# Abstract-pvpingtokens

These are an integrated underlying enchantments system based on a passive providing item that can be upgraded.

The original pvpingtokens rebuilt with configcore and reditems.

* This will not function and will not build.
* Purely for reference only now.

This system is highly complex and spanned multiple plugins. These are the two primary plugins that I worked with.
The javascript is considerably more files, but many of them had more subtle changes.
